<td>Calgary City Hall, built between1907 and 1911, is a four-storey, sandstone-clad building designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. A centrally placed clock tower dominates the structure. The building, located on the eastern edge of downtown, stands adjacent to the modern Municipal Building and comprises part of a complex of municipal administration offices and the seat of government.

<td>This building, Calgary's second city hall, marks the site of Calgary's original town hall, and has been the seat of municipal government since that time. The original town hall, built in 1885, was demolished in 1911 when this structure was completed. While many offices were transferred to the adjacent Municipal Building upon its completion in 1985, this building has always contained the offices for the mayor and aldermen and continues to house the City Clerk's office.  In addition to its location as local government offices, City Hall also served as the headquarters of the city's police department until 1914 with 15 jail cells occupying a portion of the ground floor. Additionally, the building contained the city's court room which was conveniently located on the ground floor adjacent to the police department. 

Calgary City Hall is an excellent example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture and is the preeminent example of this style in the province. Faced with sandstone obtained from the Bone and Oliver Quarry, the exterior presents a distinctive rock-faced finish, characteristic of the style. The building is further distinguished by a clock tower forming the frontispiece of the building and symmetrically placed porticos that highlight the three main façades. Ornamental rooftop lanterns are a stylistically unique feature creating an eclectic roofline. Notable interior elements include a highly ornamental cast-iron staircase and sky-lit rotundas. Completed at more than double the originally estimated cost of $142, 000, City Hall was built to be fireproof with a steel framework and reinforced concrete forming its internal structure, making it the earliest known example of steel-frame construction in Calgary. The significant cost overrun not only created immense controversy but also stalled construction resulting in the building's unusually lengthy development period of four years.

City Hall was designed by the prominent Calgary architect, William Dodd. Dodd was responsible for the ornate Central School (1905-1969) as well as numerous extant buildings including the Clarence Block (1901), Norman Block (1902), and Alexandra School (1904). Dodd was also responsible for significant commissions in Regina where his work included City Hall (1906), a project which captured the attention of Calgary's civic officials.</td>

Olympic plaza, located at the East end of Stephen Avenue, is valued as a gathering space and cultural hub for Calgarians. Since the 1988 Olympics it has evolved through time and routinely hosts numerous concerts, public events, Stampede "Rope Square" and other cultural activities, as well as ice skating in winter.  (Activity value: City Wide Significance). 

Calgary Olympic Plaza was the urban focus of community engagement, medals ceremonies and programming for the 1988 XV Olympic Games and is regarded as a symbol of Calgary's emergence as a major national economic and cultural force. (Event value: City Wide Significance)

The Plaza's proscenium screen stage feature is the only example of a classically referenced Post-Modernist construction in the city (Style value: City Wide Significance)

The Plaza has from its date of construction been the focus of city-wide festivals, cultural events, annual celebrations, commemorative ceremonies and all-season recreational use. (Landmark value: City Wide Significance)

The Plaza is the result of a long-standing civic commitment to revitalize East Calgary and develop a multi-purpose plaza within the municipal government/cultural precinct. Its joint funding and development by the Olympic Organizing Committee and The City together with broad-based citizen engagements is symbolic of Calgary's Volunteer ethic. (Symbolic value: City Wide Significance)

A need for open space in Downtown was identified in the 1974 DT Open Space Report. In 1975 Council approved an LRT system and a future tunnel beneath 8th Avenue as a future cross-downtown route and the 200 East Block as the site of an eastern-most station. A civic plaza within the Block was first identified as an objective in the 1978 Downtown Plan. Studies by R. Moriyama and H. Hanen for comprehensive re-design of the 200 and 300 E. Blocks included a Municipal Building, a Performing Arts Centre, and a Civic Square incorporated into the 1979 Civic Centre Area Redevelopment Plan (ARP). A Capital Budget was approved for the acquisition of the 200 East Block to support objectives for the Square including: open space to serve as focus for the commercial core, accommodation of private and public interests; and transition from the western office/retail district to future development of downtown E. Calgary. 

In September 1981, Calgary was awarded the 1988 Winter Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) which included requirement for a central location for the presentation of Olympic Medals. An agreement between The City of Calgary and the Calgary Winter Games Organizing Committee provided for a jointly funded budget of $3.4 m for a plaza and a legacy for the citizens of Calgary. To achieve all season use, Council dedicated an additional $1.8m. In 1985 The City invited 3 local firms to propose designs for the plaza. The commission was awarded to Gibbs Gage Partnership with landscape architect P. Friedberg as design lead. In addition to accommodating Olympic Ceremonies the proposal included components identified through a public participation process. These included: an amphitheatre below street grade and surrounded on 3 sides by terraces with stairs on the 4th; a fountain; creation of a buffered edge on Stephen Avenue; flooding of the plaza for a reflective pool in summer and skating in winter, and a Legacy Wall for Olympic plaques. A program for the paving of the Plaza with 22,000 bricks inscribed with the names of donors to Olympic events engaged the community in the site's evolution. 

In acknowledgement of The City's objective for LRT service below 8th Ave, Olympic Plaza was designed and developed as a "kit of parts" to serve a 20-year time horizon and be capable of being dismantled and re-erected in a revised configuration after the installation of a station. Subsequent decisions of Council precluded development although a tunnel below the Calgary Municipal Building was constructed. 

Demolition of 23 buildings was undertaken in the 200 E. Block to accommodate Plaza construction. At the SW corner, designation of the Dominion Bank as a Provincial Historic Site prevented its removal and only a portion of its site was dedicated for the Plaza with the NE corner reserved for future hotel/commercial use to support site activation.

Olympic Plaza was opened by the President of the IOC on September 28, 1987 and served as a focus of presentation ceremonies and related events during the Games. The Plaza has since served as focus for cultural festivals, and commemorative events and is identified with Calgary's emergent national image as a Canadian economic and cultural centre. In 1999 Council approved the SW corner of the site for one of two Famous Five Monuments to the 1929 Person's Case.

Olympic Plaza is the centrepiece of the civic government and arts precinct and features a classically referenced Post Modernist "Proscenium Screen" as backdrop to the primary stage. The Plaza is framed by 5 historic buildings: City Hall, National Historic Site; the Dominion Bank, the Cathedral Church of the Redeemer and the Burns Building, each a Provincial Historic Resource, and the Calgary Public Building, a Municipal Historic Resource.</td>

Olympic plaza, located at the East end of Stephen Avenue, is valued as a gathering space and cultural hub for Calgarians. Since the 1988 Olympics it has evolved through time and routinely hosts numerous concerts, public events, Stampede "Rope Square" and other cultural activities, as well as ice skating in winter.  (Activity value: City Wide Significance). 

Calgary Olympic Plaza was the urban focus of community engagement, medals ceremonies and programming for the 1988 XV Olympic Games and is regarded as a symbol of Calgary's emergence as a major national economic and cultural force. (Event value: City Wide Significance)

The Plaza's proscenium screen stage feature is the only example of a classically referenced Post-Modernist construction in the city (Style value: City Wide Significance)

The Plaza has from its date of construction been the focus of city-wide festivals, cultural events, annual celebrations, commemorative ceremonies and all-season recreational use. (Landmark value: City Wide Significance)

The Plaza is the result of a long-standing civic commitment to revitalize East Calgary and develop a multi-purpose plaza within the municipal government/cultural precinct. Its joint funding and development by the Olympic Organizing Committee and The City together with broad-based citizen engagements is symbolic of Calgary's Volunteer ethic. (Symbolic value: City Wide Significance) 

It was the centre-piece of the Civic Government and Cultural Precinct that was intended to link the western office and commercial core with the emerging East Village District. (Symbolic value: City Wide Significance)</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="SIGNIFICANCE_DATES">1988 February: XV Olympic Winter Games Medal Presentation Ceremonies.
2000: Millennium New Year's Eve Celebration.
2001: September: Commemorative Ceremony for 9/11 World Trade Tower.</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="SIGNIFICANCE_STMT_DSCRN">Calgary Olympic Plaza, completed in 1987 to serve as the venue for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympic Game's Medal Presentation Ceremonies, is located within the Municipal Government and Cultural Precinct at the eastern terminus of historic Stephen Avenue. This landmark 1.2-hectare built open space is designed on an orthogonal grid of hard and soft terraced landscaping focused on a central depressed square pool with a Post Modernist classically- referenced colonnaded "Proscenium Screen" stage with a secondary circular "Odeon" stage opposite</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="SIGNIFICANCE_STMT_HRTG_VAL">Olympic Plaza has symbolic and historical value for its role in the 1988 Olympic Winter Games, and annual use as the focus of New Year's Eve and other cultural and commemorative events. 

A need for open space in Downtown was identified in the 1974 DT Open Space Report. In 1975 Council approved an LRT system and a future tunnel beneath 8th Avenue as a future cross-downtown route and the 200 East Block as the site of an eastern-most station. A civic plaza within the Block was first identified as an objective in the 1978 Downtown Plan. Studies by R. Moriyama and H. Hanen for comprehensive re-design of the 200 and 300 E. Blocks included a Municipal Building, a Performing Arts Centre, and a Civic Square incorporated into the 1979 Civic Centre Area Redevelopment Plan (ARP). A Capital Budget was approved for the acquisition of the 200 East Block to support objectives for the Square including: open space to serve as focus for the commercial core, accommodation of private and public interests; and transition from the western office/retail district to future development of downtown E. Calgary. 

In September 1981, Calgary was awarded the 1988 Winter Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) which included requirement for a central location for the presentation of Olympic Medals. An agreement between The City of Calgary and the Calgary Winter Games Organizing Committee provided for a jointly funded budget of $3.4 m for a plaza and a legacy for the citizens of Calgary. To achieve all season use, Council dedicated an additional $1.8m. In 1985 The City invited 3 local firms to propose designs for the plaza. The commission was awarded to Gibbs Gage Partnership with landscape architect P. Friedberg as design lead. In addition to accommodating Olympic Ceremonies the proposal included components identified through a public participation process. These included: an amphitheatre below street grade and surrounded on 3 sides by terraces with stairs on the 4th; a fountain; creation of a buffered edge on Stephen Avenue; flooding of the plaza for a reflective pool in summer and skating in winter, and a Legacy Wall for Olympic plaques. A program for the paving of the Plaza with 22,000 bricks inscribed with the names of donors to Olympic events engaged the community in the site's evolution. 

In acknowledgement of The City's objective for LRT service below 8th Ave, Olympic Plaza was designed and developed as a "kit of parts" to serve a 20-year time horizon and be capable of being dismantled and re-erected in a revised configuration after the installation of a station. Subsequent decisions of Council precluded development although a tunnel below the Calgary Municipal Building was constructed. 

Demolition of 23 buildings was undertaken in the 200 E. Block to accommodate Plaza construction. At the SW corner, designation of the Dominion Bank as a Provincial Historic Site prevented its removal and only a portion of its site was dedicated for the Plaza with the NE corner reserved for future hotel/commercial use to support site activation.

Olympic Plaza was opened by the President of the IOC on September 28, 1987 and served as a focus of presentation ceremonies and related events during the Games. The Plaza has since served as focus for cultural festivals, and commemorative events and is identified with Calgary's emergent national image as a Canadian economic and cultural centre. In 1999 Council approved the SW corner of the site for one of two Famous Five Monuments to the 1929 Person's Case.

Olympic Plaza is the centrepiece of the civic government and arts precinct and features a classically referenced Post Modernist "Proscenium Screen" as backdrop to the primary stage. The Plaza is framed by 5 historic buildings: City Hall, National Historic Site; the Dominion Bank, the Cathedral Church of the Redeemer and the Burns Building, each a Provincial Historic Resource, and the Calgary Public Building, a Municipal Historic Resource.</SimpleData>

Standing in the centre of downtown, the tower occupies a landmark site, thereby contributing to its status. The tower occupies the site of Calgary's former C.P.R. station which had been a dominant location in the city from which the city's development emanated. The tower also terminates the vista at the end of Centre Street in downtown, a principal city street that incorporates the monumental Centre Street Bridge.
The Calgary Tower holds design significance within the national and international contexts, as one of the first towers of its type to be built anywhere. When finished it was the tallest self-supporting tower structure in the Western Hemisphere. The height of the Calgary Tower exceeded Seattle's Space Needle by 7.9m; San Antonio's Hemisfair Tower by 1.2m; and that of the Niagara Falls Seagram and Skylon Towers by 32.3m and 91.7m  respectively. The Calgary Tower was the tallest tower in Canada until 1975 when that status was claimed by Toronto's CN Tower. However, the Calgary Tower remained the country's tallest structure west of Toronto until 1983. 
Other unique design attributes of the tower include the incorporation of a revolving restaurant deck, which was only the second such feature in Canada. From an engineering perspective the tower is notable for being designed to withstand the unlikely occurrence of earthquake tremors and hurricane force winds of 160 kilometres/hour. W.G. Milne, a Calgary architect, and A. Dale and Associates, were responsible for the tower's design.
The Calgary Tower is significant in Calgary as an early example of the continuous-pour, slip-form of construction. The concrete shaft of the tower was completed in just 25 days, sometimes rising 11.88m  per day and capturing the interest of those in the construction industry worldwide. Over 2294 cubic metres of concrete were used in the pour which gave the tower's shaft a wall thickness varying from 45.72cm  at the base to 26.67cm at the top. Over 299 tonnes of locally fabricated steel from Calgary's Dominion Bridge Company were used in the tower's construction. 
The Calgary Tower holds symbolic importance to Calgarians for numerous reasons. When first considered in 1963 the tower was presented as an idea to mark Canada's Centennial in 1967, and would be the Centennial's most prominent symbol in the city. Unofficially, the tower would also symbolize Calgary's growing economic importance within the national and international context and the progressive and dynamic spirit of the city. Developed by Husky Oil and the real estate division of the Canadian Pacific Railway the tower would stand to represent two of the most powerful economic forces to shape Calgary - energy and the railway. The tower, with its adjoining office, retail and transportation development, was also promoted at the time as the cornerstone of Calgary's downtown renewal and recalls the efforts of the period to rejuvenate the centre city. 
Subsequently, the tower has become an internationally-recognized symbol of the city. This status was reinforced when the tower's spire was used to hold the Olympic flame for the 1988 Winter Olympics and when the 1988 Olympic torch was modeled upon the appearance of the tower. This focal-point role of the tower has made it one of the strongest reminders for Calgarians of that momentous event. The torch is still lit for special occasions, strengthening its symbolic association within the city.</td>

<th>SIGNIFICANCE_SUMM</th>
<td>After the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived at the site of Fort Calgary in 1883, the tiny community outside the fort quickly expanded and soon became a regional metropolis. In 1893, it became the first incorporated City in the North West Territories. Within its downtown core, a number of business blocks sprang up, including one owned by Mathew Dunn and John Lineham on Stephen Avenue, constructed of sandstone and brick during 1886-87. It was built adjoining to and in conjunction with a store owned by I.G. Baker and Co., the firm that had been contracted to build Fort Calgary in 1875. The rough sandstone facades of both buildings were identical. 

In 1890, Lineham bought out Dunn and became the sole owner of what became known as the Lineham Block. Lineham was a wealthy rancher who also represented Calgary in the North West Territories Legislative Assembly from 1888 to 1891. Among the earliest tenants in his Calgary business block were the Imperial Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal, the first two federally chartered banks in Calgary, having arrived there in 1886. In 1892, while the Bank of Montreal located elsewhere, the Imperial Bank purchased the western (I.G. Baker) half of the complex from the Hudson's Bay Company (which had acquired it a year earlier), and expanded its operation. Bank records show an expenditure of 32,000 dollars for construction work on its Calgary building in 1892. It is assumed that this would have been for the expansion and restructuring of the I.G. Baker portion of the complex, although the exterior appears not to have been altered. The expansion gave the Bank extra office space to lease. Among the early tenants to do business there, was the legal firm of Sifton, Short and Stuart, which included two of Alberta's future premiers, Arthur Sifton (1910-17) and Charles Stuart (1917-21). 

As Calgary continued to grow after the turn of the century, the demand for more banking services grew as well. The Calgary Albertan reported on February 28, 1911 that 'the Imperial Bank last summer improved its premises to the extent of over 30,000 [dollars].' With smaller alterations in later years, the Bank would continue to occupy the premises until the rapid commercial expansion of Calgary during the 1960's necessitated another facility. In 1977, the structure was designated a Provincial Historic Resource.

The historical significance of the Imperial Bank Building, tying in directly with the Lineham Block, lies in its direct association with the frantic commercial expansion of Calgary during the years prior to World War I. It is significant also in its association with two of Alberta's outstanding political leaders of the early 20th century, Arthur Sifton and Charles Stuart. It is also an excellent example of a sandstone building and it has considerable architectural merit.</td>

<td>The Imperial Bank of Canada is a two-storey building situated along downtown Calgary's historic Stephen Avenue Mall.

<td>The heritage value of the Imperial Bank of Canada building lies in its impressive Neoclassical architectural style and its reflection of the dynamic commercial growth of Calgary at the turn of the century. 

Between 1886 and 1887, the I. G. Baker Company collaborated with businessmen John Lineham and Matthew Dunn to erect two adjacent, identical sandstone buildings in Calgary's rapidly developing downtown core. The Imperial Bank of Canada (I. B. C.) acquired one of the two buildings in 1892. Between 1909 and 1911, nationally renowned Toronto architects Frank Darling and John Pearson and locally significant architects Hodgson, Bates, and Beatty radically altered the structure, converting the I. B. C. from a fairly simple building to an impressive embodiment of Neoclassical architectural ideals. Some elements of the original construction still remain, including the interior wall shared with the adjacent building. The Neoclassical style was popular for bank buildings at the time because of its association with the qualities of strength, balance, and permanence. This style is evident in the building's roofline cornice underlined by block modillions, decorative armorial shield designs, and the prominent parapet. Several other Neoclassical features, including the building's symmetry and a columned entranceway surmounted by a pediment, have since been altered or removed. Constructed with rough-faced sandstone and situated along Calgary's historic Stephen Avenue Mall, the Imperial Bank of Canada is an integral part of the city's premier heritage streetscape. 

The Imperial Bank of Canada building recalls the frantic commercial growth of Calgary in the years prior to the First World War. The I. B.C. was the first chartered bank to open in Calgary, establishing its presence in the community in 1886. The dramatic transformation of the bank's downtown branch from a frontier building to a bold Neoclassical construction symbolizes the burgeoning population and self-confidence of Calgary during the boom years in the city prior to the First World War. The building's location and impressive architecture attracted some of Calgary's pre-eminent businesses to take up office space on the second floor of the bank. Significant early tenants in the building include the law firm of Sifton, Short, and Stuart. Arthur L. Sifton served as Premier of Alberta from 1910 until 1917 and Charles Stuart was a Member of the Legislative Assembly, an Alberta Supreme Court judge, and the Chancellor of the University of Alberta.

<SimpleData name="SIGNIFICANCE_SUMM">After the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived at the site of Fort Calgary in 1883, the tiny community outside the fort quickly expanded and soon became a regional metropolis. In 1893, it became the first incorporated City in the North West Territories. Within its downtown core, a number of business blocks sprang up, including one owned by Mathew Dunn and John Lineham on Stephen Avenue, constructed of sandstone and brick during 1886-87. It was built adjoining to and in conjunction with a store owned by I.G. Baker and Co., the firm that had been contracted to build Fort Calgary in 1875. The rough sandstone facades of both buildings were identical. 

In 1890, Lineham bought out Dunn and became the sole owner of what became known as the Lineham Block. Lineham was a wealthy rancher who also represented Calgary in the North West Territories Legislative Assembly from 1888 to 1891. Among the earliest tenants in his Calgary business block were the Imperial Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal, the first two federally chartered banks in Calgary, having arrived there in 1886. In 1892, while the Bank of Montreal located elsewhere, the Imperial Bank purchased the western (I.G. Baker) half of the complex from the Hudson's Bay Company (which had acquired it a year earlier), and expanded its operation. Bank records show an expenditure of 32,000 dollars for construction work on its Calgary building in 1892. It is assumed that this would have been for the expansion and restructuring of the I.G. Baker portion of the complex, although the exterior appears not to have been altered. The expansion gave the Bank extra office space to lease. Among the early tenants to do business there, was the legal firm of Sifton, Short and Stuart, which included two of Alberta's future premiers, Arthur Sifton (1910-17) and Charles Stuart (1917-21). 

As Calgary continued to grow after the turn of the century, the demand for more banking services grew as well. The Calgary Albertan reported on February 28, 1911 that 'the Imperial Bank last summer improved its premises to the extent of over 30,000 [dollars].' With smaller alterations in later years, the Bank would continue to occupy the premises until the rapid commercial expansion of Calgary during the 1960's necessitated another facility. In 1977, the structure was designated a Provincial Historic Resource.

The historical significance of the Imperial Bank Building, tying in directly with the Lineham Block, lies in its direct association with the frantic commercial expansion of Calgary during the years prior to World War I. It is significant also in its association with two of Alberta's outstanding political leaders of the early 20th century, Arthur Sifton and Charles Stuart. It is also an excellent example of a sandstone building and it has considerable architectural merit.</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="SIGNIFICANCE_STMT_DSCRN">The Imperial Bank of Canada is a two-storey building situated along downtown Calgary's historic Stephen Avenue Mall. It embodies the Neoclassical architectural style and features a rough-faced sandstone exterior, decorative sandstone shields, a roofline cornice underlined by block modillions, and a parapet.</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="SIGNIFICANCE_STMT_HRTG_VAL">The heritage value of the Imperial Bank of Canada building lies in its impressive Neoclassical architectural style and its reflection of the dynamic commercial growth of Calgary at the turn of the century. 

Between 1886 and 1887, the I. G. Baker Company collaborated with businessmen John Lineham and Matthew Dunn to erect two adjacent, identical sandstone buildings in Calgary's rapidly developing downtown core. The Imperial Bank of Canada (I. B. C.) acquired one of the two buildings in 1892. Between 1909 and 1911, nationally renowned Toronto architects Frank Darling and John Pearson and locally significant architects Hodgson, Bates, and Beatty radically altered the structure, converting the I. B. C. from a fairly simple building to an impressive embodiment of Neoclassical architectural ideals. Some elements of the original construction still remain, including the interior wall shared with the adjacent building. The Neoclassical style was popular for bank buildings at the time because of its association with the qualities of strength, balance, and permanence. This style is evident in the building's roofline cornice underlined by block modillions, decorative armorial shield designs, and the prominent parapet. Several other Neoclassical features, including the building's symmetry and a columned entranceway surmounted by a pediment, have since been altered or removed. Constructed with rough-faced sandstone and situated along Calgary's historic Stephen Avenue Mall, the Imperial Bank of Canada is an integral part of the city's premier heritage streetscape. 

The Imperial Bank of Canada building recalls the frantic commercial growth of Calgary in the years prior to the First World War. The I. B.C. was the first chartered bank to open in Calgary, establishing its presence in the community in 1886. The dramatic transformation of the bank's downtown branch from a frontier building to a bold Neoclassical construction symbolizes the burgeoning population and self-confidence of Calgary during the boom years in the city prior to the First World War. The building's location and impressive architecture attracted some of Calgary's pre-eminent businesses to take up office space on the second floor of the bank. Significant early tenants in the building include the law firm of Sifton, Short, and Stuart. Arthur L. Sifton served as Premier of Alberta from 1910 until 1917 and Charles Stuart was a Member of the Legislative Assembly, an Alberta Supreme Court judge, and the Chancellor of the University of Alberta.

<td>This sandstone church, the second permanent home of the Anglican congregation which first met late in 1883, was built in 1904-05 to designs by architect John Charles Malcolm Keith of Victoria. The low profile and compact massing of the building are inspired by parish churches of England, in distinction to the taller cathedral form seen in Keith's most distinguished design, Christ Church Cathedral in Victoria.

The Cathedral Church of the Redeemer building was designed and conceived as a parish church, and served as the pro-cathedral of the Diocese of Calgary until 1949, when it was designated the cathedral. The cornerstone was laid in 1904 by the Governor General, the Earl of Minto. The interior contains many fine fittings and furnishings, including a fine pulpit, many stained glass windows and the roodscreen dedicated in 1919 by the Prince of Wales. A new Lady Chapel was dedicated in 1936. New wood panelling was added along the lower walls and the pillars, and the doors were remodelled in 1952. 

The congregation has included many distinguished Calgarians, and was supported by non-Anglicans as well as parishioners. Four Calgarians who are remembered in the stained glass windows are William Roper Hull, Prime Minister R.B. Bennett, William Pearce, and Senator Patrick Burns. Paget Hall, which was built in 1911 just east of the church, was demolished in the 1970s to provide space for a landscaped park. The cathedral was designated a Provincial Historic Resource in 1977.

<td>The heritage value of the Cathedral Church of the Redeemer lies chiefly in its association with the early presence of the Anglican Church in Alberta. The building is further significant for its value as an example of Gothic Revival architecture accented by influences from other styles. 

The Anglican Church was present in the Northwest Territories from the mid-nineteenth century, with missionaries being provided by English organizations such as Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In the early 1880s, the Reverend John William Tims celebrated the first Anglican services in the Calgary region, and the Reverend Edward Paske Smith organized the group of largely English settlers which was to become the Church of the Redeemer. The parish constructed a wooden church in 1884, which served as the only Anglican parish in Calgary until 1905, when it was determined that Calgary would become the seat of a new Anglican Diocese, and the parish would become the Pro-Cathedral (a temporary designation). For forty-eight years the Diocese of Calgary was led from the cathedral by Bishop William Cyprian Pinkham, a key figure in the establishment of the Anglican faith in Alberta. Other notable clergy, including the Reverend C. E. Paget, also served in the cathedral.

The Cathedral Church of the Redeemer represents an eclectic combination of Gothic Revival architecture with various European influences. Scottish-born architect John C. M. Keith was commissioned in 1903 to design the church. Highly distinguishable from other Gothic Revival churches in Calgary at the time, Keith's plan, without a tower, evokes not only the ethos of English parish churches, but also elements of the gothicized German style going back to the Romanesque period. The specific stylistic combination represented in the cathedral's architecture is unique in Alberta. Several significant stained glass windows offset the robust architectural structure, including the work of the McCausland Company of Toronto, Spence Brothers of Montreal, and William Morris and Company of Merton Abbey in England. The stained glass windows entitled "I am the Good Shepherd," "The Raising of Jairus' Daughter," and "I am the Alpha and Omega" were present in the original 1884 wooden Church of the Redeemer, and were installed in the present building by McCausland and Company when the cathedral was built in 1905.</td>

The parish constructed a wooden church in 1884, which served as the only Anglican parish in Calgary until 1905, when it was determined that Calgary would become the seat of a new Anglican Diocese, and the parish would become the Pro-Cathedral (a temporary designation). For forty-eight years the Diocese of Calgary was led from the cathedral by Bishop William Cyprian Pinkham, a key figure in the establishment of the Anglican faith in Alberta. Other notable clergy, including the Reverend C. E. Paget, also served in the cathedral.

The Cathedral Church of the Redeemer represents an eclectic combination of Gothic Revival architecture with various European influences. Scottish-born architect John C. M. Keith was commissioned in 1903 to design the church. Highly distinguishable from other Gothic Revival churches in Calgary at the time, Keith's plan, without a tower, evokes not only the ethos of English parish churches, but also elements of the gothicized German style going back to the Romanesque period. The specific stylistic combination represented in the cathedral's architecture is unique in Alberta. Several significant stained glass windows offset the robust architectural structure, including the work of the McCausland Company of Toronto, Spence Brothers of Montreal, and William Morris and Company of Merton Abbey in England. The stained glass windows entitled "I am the Good Shepherd," "The Raising of Jairus' Daughter," and "I am the Alpha and Omega" were present in the original 1884 wooden Church of the Redeemer, and were installed in the present building by McCausland and Company when the cathedral was built in 1905.</SimpleData>
